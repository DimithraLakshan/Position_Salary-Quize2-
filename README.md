# Position Salary Prediction (Quize 2)

This repository contains a simple machine learning implementation to predict the salary of a position given its level. The main purpose of this assignment is to understand the basics of polynomial regression, concepts of underfitting and overfitting, and how to choose the best degree for a regression model.

## Project Purpose

- Learn and demonstrate polynomial regression using Python.
- Visualize model fitting and observe the effects of underfitting/overfitting.
- Evaluate and compare model performance with different polynomial degrees (1, 2, 3, 4).

## Approach

- Used the entire dataset for training (as instructed).
- Checked the R² score of polynomial regression models for degrees 1, 2, 3, and 4.
- Utilized Python and Google Colab for implementation and experimentation.

## Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter/Google Colab
- Libraries: `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scikit-learn` (for regression and metrics)

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) or locally using Jupyter.
3. Run all cells to reproduce results and modify polynomial degrees as needed.

## File Structure

- `Position_Salary_Data.csv` - The dataset used for training and prediction.
- `polynomial_regression.ipynb` (or similarly named notebook) - Contains the code and results.

## Results

- Compared R² scores for polynomial degrees.
- Visualized model fits to demonstrate underfitting and overfitting.
